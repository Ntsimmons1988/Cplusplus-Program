CS 210 Module Eight Journal Guidelines 

 

Summarize the project and what problem it was solving. 
What did you do particularly well? 
Where could you enhance your code? How would these improvements make your code more efficient, secure, and so on? 
Which pieces of the code did you find most challenging to write, and how did you overcome this? What tools or resources are you adding to your support network? 
What skills from this project will be particularly transferable to other projects or course work? 
How did you make this program maintainable, readable, and adaptable? 
 

 

 

This project was about developing a program for Airgead Banking that teaches the students from the local high school that they sponsor the concepts of fiscal responsibility. The bank wanted the program to be interactive and to focus on investing and the power of compound interest. 

In this project I showed proof of my ability to write constructors and initialize them, get output from.... and write clean organized code.  I was also able to prove my skills by connecting a header file to a source file to compile into one program. I made this program maintainable, readable, and adaptable by utilizing common naming conventions and camel case notation. I also did this by having most of my code in the class and putting a minimal amount of code in main. I did a better job on this program than my first one, that is why I decided to post this one.  

The most challenging part of this project was getting the calculations to output. I kept getting 0 instead of the equation I provided in the code. With this code I should have come up with a better solution to generate the correct results. I should have done a try/ catch statement as well.
